# Robotic-Arm-with-4DOF-controlled-by-Smartphone
The following study describes the design and implementation of a robotic arm that has 4 degrees of freedom, used to lift
objects from a certain specific point and leave them in another place. In the document, the kinematic study of the robot can be evidenced,
both the mechanical and electronic design, in addition, an application for cell phones was designed and programmed, through which the
robot and all its movements will be controlled, in the application it can be controlled in a manual controls by sliding or automatically by
direct and inverse kinematics and you can also see the respective tests carried out on the prototype, to obtain smooth and easily controllable
movements.
